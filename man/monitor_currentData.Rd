\title{Create a dataframe of current monitor data}
\usage{
monitor_currentData(ws_monitor, datetime = lubridate::now("UTC"),
  monitoringUrlBase = "http://tools.airfire.org/monitoring/v4/#/?monitors=")
}
\arguments{
\item{ws_monitor}{\emph{ws_monitor} object}

\item{datetime}{Time to which data will be 'current' (integer or character representing YYYYMMDDHH or \code{POSIXct}. 
If not \code{POSIXct}, interpreted as UTC time). 
So if \code{datetime} is 3 hours ago, a dataframe with the most current data from 3 hours ago will be returned.}

\item{monitoringUrlBase}{base URL for constructing a link to the PWFSL Smoke Monitoring site}
}
\value{
A tibble of "lastValid" data and associated timing information.
}
\description{
Extracts current status data from a ws_monitor object. In addition to monitor metadata, the returned data include the following:
\itemize{
\item{\code{monitorID} - the PWFSL monitor ID}
\item{\code{lastValidTime} - UTC POSIXct time corresponding to the last valid pm25 datum}
\item{\code{lastValidLocalTimestamp} - ASCII version of \code{lastValidTime} in monitor-local timezone}
\item{\code{processingTime} - UTC POSIXct when the function is run (\emph{i.e.} 'now')}
\item{\code{datetime} - UTC POSIXct of the datetime that the data represents. See \code{datetime} parameter. In most instances, the same as \code{processingTime}}
\item{\code{latency} - (difference between processingTime -1 hr) and lastValidTime, floored to the hour}
\item{\code{lastValid_PM2.5_nowcast} - NowCast value at lastValidTime}
\item{\code{lastValid_PM2.5_1hr} - PM2.5 value at lastValidTime (should never be null)}
\item{\code{lastValid_PM2.5_3hr} - mean of the three hours preceeding lastValidTime}
\item{\code{yesterday_PM2.5_24hr} - local time midnight-to-midnight 24-hour mean for the day prior to processingTime}
\item{\code{monitoringSiteUrl} - URL to PWFSL Monitoring v4 site, initialized with a specific monitor}
}
The three-hour average will remove missing values and may represent an average of 1-3 hours.

The yesterday average will remove up to six missing values, returning \code{NA} if more than six hours of yesterday's data are missing.

Any monitors with no data from before the desired datetime will be excluded. 

\strong{NOTE:} \code{yesterday_PM2.5_24hr} represents yesterday relative to \code{datetime} -- \emph{i.e.} actually yesterday.
The various 'lastValid' values describe the most recent valid values -- before \code{datetime}, whenever they occurred.
}
\details{
Data are assigned to the beginning of the hour they represent. So a PM2.5 value assigned to 2pm
will represent data averaged over the period 14:00 - 14:59. This is in keeping with a day representing
00:00 - 23:59 and a month representing the beginning of the month until the end of the month.

Because of this, data for 2pm should never be available until just after 3pm. If it is currently 3:15pm
then we need to subtract 1 hour from the current \code{processingTime} before subtracting the \code{lastValidTime}
to generate the \code{latency}.

The parameter \code{datetime} is meant to simulate current data at a time different from the current time. Therefore, when \code{datetime}
is specified, the returned dataframe will represent data up to an hour before \code{datetime}.
