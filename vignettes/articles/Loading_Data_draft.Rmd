## Welcome to the data archive
* temporary monitors ([AIRSIS](https://app.airsis.com/USFS) and [WRCC](http://www.wrcc.dri.edu)) vs. permanent monitors ([AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov)), which are sites archiving PM2.5 data, the primary pollutant caused by wilfire smoke.
* three types of archive files — hourly, daily, monthly
* structure of the archive
## loading files directly from the archive with get(load(url(…)))
* loading functions
* ~loadLatest, ~loadDaily, ~loadAnnual
* monitor_load() — the preferred function for general data loading
* note — no ability to cross year boundaries (OK because there are few wildfires on New Year’s Eve)
## examples
* most current example -- load and create plot the using Latest data for Washington
* archival example — load and create plot using data from OR-ID-WA during 2015 (this is the package dataset Northwest Megafires but obtain the data from the archive)
