## Welcome to the data archive

* WIP: temporary monitors (WRCC, AIRSIS) vs. permanent monitors (AirNow)

The archive hosts PM2.5 data generated by temporary and permanent monitors. The agencies providing this data are: [AIRSIS](https://app.airsis.com/USFS) and [WRCC](http://www.wrcc.dri.edu)(Western Regional Climate Center), using temporary monitors; [AirNow](https://www.airnow.gov)), using permanet monitors. 

* WIP: three types of archive files — hourly, daily, monthly

Each agency provides hourly, daily, monthly data. 
Latest data from all agencies available in [latest/RData](https://haze.airfire.org/monitoring/latest/RData/) subdirectory. 

Explain more about the difference (10 vs 45). 

* TO DO: structure of the archive


## loading files directly from the archive with get(load(url(…)))
* TO DO: loading functions
* TO DO: ~loadLatest, ~loadDaily, ~loadAnnual
* TO DO: monitor_load() — the preferred function for general data loading
* TO DO: note — no ability to cross year boundaries (OK because there are few wildfires on New Year’s Eve)


## examples
* TO DO: most current example -- load and create plot the using Latest data for Washington
* TO DO: archival example — load and create plot using data from OR-ID-WA during 2015 (this is the package dataset Northwest Megafires but obtain the data from the archive)
