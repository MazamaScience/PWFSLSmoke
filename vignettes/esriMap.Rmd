This vignette covers the `esriMap_*` functions included in the package, which provide functionality for downloading and and using ESRI basemaps for making beautiful maps. 

## Getting and Plotting ESRI basemaps

### esriMap_getMap()  
This function will query the [ArcGIS REST services API](http://server.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/) to:  
 * download a .png of the basemap with the desired zoom and extent  
 * load the basemap into the environment as a `raster::Raster*` object  
 
The minimum information needed is the center values for latitude and longitude: 
```{r getMap_example}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(PWFSLSmoke))
centerLon <- -122.384
centerLat <- 47.666
map <- esriMap_getMap(centerLon, centerLat, zoom = 10)
map
```
 
### esriMap_plotOnStaticMap()
Once a map is loaded, it can be plotted using `esriMap_plotOnStaticMap()`. This base plotting capabilities build into the `raster` package to plot the basemap. Points and lines can be added using base R plotting functionality.

```{r plot_example}
esriMap_plotOnStaticMap(map)
addMarker(centerLon, centerLat)
```

## Creating beautiful maps with Esri maps

Let's use an Esri basemap to create a map of smoke monitors in the western United States. We start off by fetching the basemap with appropriate zoom and size. We will center it in Nevada, with a zoom level of 5. We will use the world_shaded_relief basemap because it is simple but will give us some context. 

```{r get_map}
map <- esriMap_getMap(-119.369, 42.4502453, zoom = 5, width = 500, height = 500, maptype = "world_shaded_relief")
```

Now let's get some monitoring data to plot, using `PWFSLSmoke::loadLatest()`. 

```{r loadLatest}
monitors <- loadLatest()
```

Next, let's add some additional locations of interest, perhaps fires. 

```{r fires}
fires_lon <- c(-122.1, -120.4, -121.7)
fires_lat <- c(39.5, 44.4, 43.9)
```

Finally, plot all of it together. 

```{r makeMap}
par(pty = 's')
esriMap_plotOnStaticMap(map)
maps::map('state', add = TRUE)
monitorMap(monitors, add = TRUE)
addIcon('redFlame', fires_lon, fires_lat, expansion = 0.005)
```



## Available Map Types

The ESRI map server includes many different styles of maps. Several are built into the function but you can ask for other custom maps, which can be found [here](http://server.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/). 

You can specify the map resource to download using the `maptype` argument. Built into the function are five maptypes:   
 * natGeo  
 * worldStreetMap  
 * worldTopoMap  
 * satellite  
 * deLorme  

But there are many map resources that are possible to download. Below are examples from 16 different basemap options, and their corresponding descriptons as of October, 2018: 

### Satellite Imagery:

#### Ocean/World_Ocean_Base

*This map is designed to be used as a base map by marine GIS professionals and as a reference map by anyone interested in ocean data. The base map features marine bathymetry. Land features include inland waters and roads overlaid on land cover and shaded relief imagery. The map was compiled from a variety of best available sources from several data providers, including General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans GEBCO_08 Grid, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and National Geographic, Garmin, HERE, Geonames.org, and Esri, and various other contributors. The base map currently provides coverage for the world down to a scale of ~1:577k, and coverage down to 1:72k in US coastal areas, and various other areas. Coverage down to ~ 1:9k is available limited areas based on regional hydrographic survey data. The base map was designed and developed by Esri. NOTE: Data from the GEBCO_08 grid shall not to be used for navigation or for any other purpose relating to safety at sea. The GEBCO_08 Grid is largely based on a database of ship-track soundings with interpolation between soundings guided by satellite-derived gravity data. In some areas, data from existing grids are included. The GEBCO_08 Grid does not contain detailed information in shallower water areas, information concerning the generation of the grid can be found on GEBCO's web site: GEBCO. The GEBCO_08 Grid is accompanied by a Source Identifier (SID) Grid which indicates which cells in the GEBCO_08 Grid are based on soundings or existing grids and which have been interpolated. The latest version of both grids and accompanying documentation is available to download, on behalf of GEBCO, from the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) BODC. The names of the IHO (International Hydrographic Organization), IOC (intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission), GEBCO (General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans), NERC (Natural Environment Research Council) or BODC (British Oceanographic Data Centre) may not be used in any way to imply, directly or otherwise, endorsement or support of either the Licensee or their mapping system.
