#' @description A Nowcast algorithm is applied to the data in in the ws_monitor object. The
#' \code{version} argument specifies the minimum weight factor and number of hours to be
#' considered in the calculation.
#'
#' Available versions include:
#' \enumerate{
#' \item{\code{pm}}: {hours=12, weight=0.5}
#' \item{\code{pmAsian}}: {hours=3, weight=0.1}
#' \item{\code{ozone}}: {hours=8, weight=NA}
#' }
#'
#' The default, \code{version='pm'}, is appropriate for typical usage.
#'
#' @details
#' This function calculates the current hour's NowCast value based on the value for the given hour and the previous N-1 hours, where N is the number
#' of hours corresponding to the \code{version} argument (see \strong{Description} above). For example, if \code{version=pm}, then the NowCast value
#' for Hour 12 is based on the data from Hours 1-12.
#'
#' The function requires valid data for at least two of the three latest hours; NA's are returned for hours where this condition is not met.
#'
#' By default, the funtion will not return a valid value until the Nth hour. If \code{includeShortTerm=TRUE}, the function will return a valid value
#' after only the 2nd hour (provided, of course, that both hours are valid).
#'
#' Calculated Nowcast values are truncated to the nearest .1 ug/m3 for 'pm' and nearest
#' .001 ppm for 'ozone' regardless of the precision of the data in the incoming \emph{ws_monitor} object.

#### ----- NowCast Calculation Overview -----
#
# The process for calculating the NowCast concentration and AQI for PM2.5 or PM10 is as follows:
#
# 1. Compute the concentrations range (max-min) over the last 12 hours.
# 2. Divide the range by the maximum concentration in the 12 hour period to obtain the scaled rate of change.
# 3. Compute the weight factor by subtracting the scaled rate from 1. The weight factor must be between .5 and 1.
#    The minimum limit approximates a 3-hour average. If the weight factor is less than .5, then set it equal to .5.
# 4. Multiply each hourly concentration by the weight factor raised to the power of how many hours ago the concentration
#    was measured (for the current hour, the factor is raised to the zero power).
# 5. Compute the NowCast by summing these products and dividing by the sum of the weight factors raised to the power of
#    how many hours ago the concentration was measured.
